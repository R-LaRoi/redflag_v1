# RedFlag: Your Job Scam Detector

**RedFlag** is a browser extension designed to help you quickly identify potential job scams on major job boards, right in your browser. Using intelligent, client-side analysis, RedFlag gives you real-time insights so you can apply with confidence.

## Why RedFlag?

RedFlag acts as your personal fraud detection assistant, analyzing job descriptions as you browse and flagging common scam indicators. This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) uses a heuristic-based approach, meaning it applies a set of rules and patterns to detect red flags directly on the page, keeping your data private and secure.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant feedback on job listings as you browse.
- **Intelligent Heuristics**: Our rule-based detection system is built to spot common scam patterns and indicators.
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: See analysis results directly on the job listing page, integrated seamlessly into your browsing experience.
- **User Reporting**: Help us improve! Report suspicious listings directly through the extension.
- **Privacy-First**: Your data stays with you. All analysis is performed client-side; no information is sent to external servers.
- **Local Storage**: Settings and reports are stored securely on your device.
- **Configurable Settings**: Adjust analysis sensitivity and display preferences.

## How It Works

RedFlag injects a content script into supported job board pages. This script:

1.  **Extracts Job Data**: It identifies and extracts key information like job title, company name, description, and salary details from the page.
2.  **Performs Heuristic Analysis**: It applies a series of pre-defined rules and pattern checks to the extracted data. These heuristics look for common red flags associated with job scams (e.g., poor grammar, unrealistic salary claims, vague company details, suspicious keywords).
3.  **Displays Results**: An analysis summary and risk score are displayed directly on the page, providing immediate feedback.
4.  **Popup Interface**: The extension popup allows you to manage settings, view job details, report listings, and re-trigger analysis.

All processing happens locally in your browser, ensuring your activity and job search data remain private.
